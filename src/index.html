                    Perry the Platypus, also known as Agent P, is a unique and beloved superhero character from the
                    animated series Phineas and Ferb.
                    He is an anthropomorphic bipedal platypus who leads a secret double life as a spy working for the
                    espionage organization known as <em>O.W.C.A.</em> (Organization Without a Cool Acronym).
                    While he appears as a simple pet to the Flynn-Fletcher family, Perry is a skilled secret agent who
                    fights the evil scientist Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz and foils his schemes to take over the tri-state
                    area.

        Perry is able to pull a remarkable number of items out of the air from behind his back. Where exactly they are
        hidden is not obvious because Perry typically does not wear clothes. <b>The most frequent gadgets he uses
        are</b>:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b><em>Wrist communicator</em></b> &mdash; Perry wears a watch-like communicator on his front left
            paw, and one on his front right paw, although it could be the same watch. It is normally hidden by his fur.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b><em>Video communicator</em></b> &mdash; Agent P uses a PDA-like, video-chatting device to
            communicate with his headquarters. Dr. Doofenshmirtz once built a "Monster Truck Locate-inator" that looked
            the same as Agent P's communicator, just a different color.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b><em>Notepad and pencil</em></b> &mdash; Perry uses it to write down notes for his missions, but
            where he has it while not using it is unknown. Perry has also been seen drawing Major Monogram on the
            notepad while being briefed for a mission.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b><em>Laptop</em></b> &mdash; Agent P has a teal laptop with a yellow footprint on the cover
            which he uses to tap into and reprogram the GPS system on the Flynn-Fletcher's rental recreational vehicle.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b><em>Fedora</em></b> &mdash; Agent P's fedora serves several purposes. First of all, the hat
            identifies him as a secret agent.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b><em>Parachute</em></b> &mdash; Agent P, while many times escaping by jumping off something high
            like a building or a plane, is able to use a parachute with a picture of his face on it, though when he
            switches bodies with Candace, the image was replaced by a picture of Jeremy.
            <del>It is unclear where he keeps
                it.
            </del>
            He's so cool with hiding it so well!
        </li>

                    me!</q> &mdash; Dr. Doofenshmirtz
            </li>
            <li>
                <q>Curse you, Perry the Platypus!</q> &mdash; Dr. Doofenshmirtz
            </li>
